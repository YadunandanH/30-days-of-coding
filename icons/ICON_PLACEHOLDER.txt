ICON PLACEHOLDER

To use this extension, you need to create three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

QUICK SOLUTION:
1. Open ../create_icons.html in your browser
2. Download the generated icons
3. Save them in this folder

ALTERNATIVE:
Create simple colored squares in any image editor:
- Use colors: #667eea or #764ba2 (extension theme colors)
- Add symbols like ✓ (checkmark) or ⏰ (clock) if desired
- Save as PNG files with exact names above

The extension will not load without these icon files!
